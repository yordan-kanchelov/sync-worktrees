Add default worktree directory based on repository name

- Interactive setup now suggests `./[repo-name]` as the default worktree directory
- Users can press Enter to accept the default or provide a custom path
- Reduces the number of required inputs during setup
- Creates a cleaner directory structure without unnecessary nesting
